    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <p>
        Hello everyone! We are group 3 from the class Digitial Humanities and Archival Design at UC Berkeley. This is a digital archive/collection project that focused on kitchenware from different cultural backgrounds. We included two main categories: Chopsticks and Pots and included several 3D models to better illustrate the objects. We think it is important to digitize these items because they provide a fairly unique lens through which to analyze cultural differences, as kitchenware is an often overlooked aspect of culture. Variations in kitchenware items reveal great details about a country's history, and even items that seem functionally indistinguishable to certain audiences, like wood chopsticks and silver chopsticks, contain nuances that indicate their divergent developments. Including these on our website can provide an opportunity for people to learn more about other cultures; a careful eye to the minute details of everyday life can provide as much insight as grand historical monuments. <br><br>

        This project is based on the framework <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and we use HTML/CSS to make it more visually interesting. We built our 3D models with <a href="https://www.agisoft.com/">MetaShape</a> and uploaded them on <a href="https://sketchfab.com/?adgroupid=27069088621&targetid=kwd-434109508027&location=9001561&matchtype=e&adposition=&utm_campaign=358341061&utm_source=googleads&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=414556469961&utm_term=sketch%20fab&hsa_acc=5570916373&hsa_cam=358341061&hsa_grp=27069088621&hsa_ad=414556469961&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-434109508027&hsa_kw=sketch%20fab&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=CjwKCAjwi8iXBhBeEiwAKbUofXFA6H9KNai-Ea7f9KMhZIXVWJJSR4GfLpE4kwXPjjzpgI37VBJkvBoCaxsQAvD_BwE">Sketchfab</a>.
